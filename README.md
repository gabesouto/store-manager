# Store Manager Project

In this project, I developed an API using a layered architecture!

The API I created is a sales management system, allowing the creation, viewing, deletion, and updating of products and sales. I used the MySQL database to manage data effectively. Additionally, the API was developed following RESTful principles.

Throughout the development of this project, I created comprehensive tests to ensure the functionality of the implementations, thereby reinforcing my skills as a developer.

During this project, I was able to:

- Successfully interact with a MySQL relational database;
- Implement a robust and well-structured API, following the layered architecture;
- Ensure data integrity by implementing validations for the data received by the API;
- Reinforce my skills by writing effective tests for the APIs, ensuring the correct implementation of endpoints.

I am satisfied with the result of this project and excited to continue improving my skills while facing new exciting challenges!
